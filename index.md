[My name is Salma Abdelhamid and I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics candidate at Simon Business School. My background is in Finance and I was a Financial Analyst at UnitedHealthcare. That was a valuable experience as I managed a $12M portfolio of internal technology investments, project managed a software development, and streamlined processes.]

## Career Passion
[I have always been passionate about programming, data, and business strategy. In high school, I learned the Microsoft Office suite, Java, HTML, and Visual Basic. Going into college, I had planned on only pursuing a business degree. In my junior year, I took an Accounting Information Systems class, which reminded me of my passion towards data and programming. That summer I completed all classes for a Database Technologies minor and learned SQL. At UnitedHealthcare, I was granted access to the capital spending database and spent my free time analyzing the data in the database. I was curious so I decided to learn more by pursuing Business Analytics. At Simon, I learned:
•	use R for statistical analysis, data cleaning, and transforming.
•	use Python to explore data and write various machine learning algorithms.
•	use Tableau to create dashboards and visualize insights highlighting important details.
•	how to perform text analytics, predictive modeling, a/b testing analysis, and exploratory analytics.
•	what is Big Data, HDFS, Hive, Pig, Hadoop, Spark, Sqooq, Flume, IoT, OLAP, OLTP
•	pricing policies and pricing analytics to determine Nash equilibrium price
•	encryption/decryption, cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, FinTech
In summary, I am passionate about programming, data, and business strategy. I am currently actively seeking opportunities where I can utilize my technical skills to dig into data and extract insights to drive value-added decision making for business entities.]
